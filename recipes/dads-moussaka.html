            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is the moussaka recipe my dad has used for ages. I have no idea when he first started making it. We're not exactly Greek. But I've been to Greece, and I like this recipe better than what I had there. (Please don't murder me!)</p>
            <p>In Greece, moussaka tends to be made with ground beef. However, Dad always makes it with ground lamb, and I will never turn down an opportunity to eat lamb in any form.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a heavy skillet or pot. Cook onions until soft and transparent.</li>
                <li>Add ground lamb, breaking apart with a spoon. Let simmer a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Stirring constantly, add wine, tomatoes and herbs. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Cover and simmer 30 minutes, then let cool.</li>
                <li>Add egg whites and two tablespoons breadcrumbs. Stir.</li>
                <li>Partially peel eggplant in lengthwise stripes. Cut off stem end and slice in 1/3-inch rounds.</li>
                <li>Salt eggplant on both sides and let sweat on a wooden board until you see plenty of water beaded on the outside. Rinse and dry.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350&#8457;.</li>
                <li>Arrange eggplant slices in a single layer on a baking sheet greased with cooking spray. Bake until brown, then turn and brown other side.</li>
                <li>To prepare the white sauce (salsa aspri), melt 3 tablespoons butter. Stir in 3 tablespoons flour and cook over medium heat until light brown. Gradually stir in 1 1/2 cups warm milk. Let cool.</li>
                <li>Add 3 egg yolks and 3/4 cup parmesan to white sauce. Stir well.</li>
                <li>Grease a 9x12-inch casserole and sprinkle lightly with breadcrumbs. Line bottom of casserole with half of the eggplant slices. Cover completely with 1/2 of meat sauce, then 1/2 of white sauce. Add a second layer of eggplant. Cover with the rest of the meat sauce and the white sauce. Sprinkle with remaining parmesan, breadcrumbs and nutmeg to taste.</li>
                <li>Bake for 35 minutes, or until golden brown and bubbling.</li>
