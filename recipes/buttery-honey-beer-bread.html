    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I got this recipe from my dear, departed mother-in-law. She was at our house one time, and pulled out the recipe, neatly hand-written on a piece of flowery stationary. She taped it to one of our top kitchen cabinets. That was over 7 years ago, and it's still there. I can't bring myself to take it down, now that she's gone.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (12g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp (6g) salt</li>
        <li>3 tbsp (64g) honey</li>
        <li>1 bottle (12 oz) beer</li>
        <li>4 tbsp melted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350&#8457;.</li>
        <li>Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the honey and beer. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Spread batter evenly in prepared pan. Pour the melted butter over the top of the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean and the top is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Turn the loaf out onto a wire rack for cooling.</li>
    </ol>
