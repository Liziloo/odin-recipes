    <h1>Aunt Alice's Christmas Cookies</h1>

    <img src="../images/aunt-alice-cookies.jpg" alt="iced-sugar-cookies" />

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are a longstanding Casler family tradition. "Alice" is my dad's cousin Alice. One of the sweetest, most patient, uncomplaining people in history of the world, she contracted polio as a child, and spent the rest of her life with very limited mobility. In fact, when I knew her, she had lived in a nursing home, confined to her bed, for years. But I never saw her without the biggest, brightest smile on her face.</p>

    <p>These cookies are really all about the frosting. The dough is nothing special. Many times, we simply used a roll of store-bought sugar cookie dough, rolled out and cut into holiday shapes. But there's just something about the icing, that transforms that humble base into something...well. You'll have to see for yourself.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h4>Dough</h4>
        <li>1 1/4 cups butter</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 3/4 cups flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
        <li>1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk</li>
        <h4>Frosting</h4>
        <li>1 stick softened butter</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 1/3 cups powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h4>Make the Dough</h4>
        <li>Beat together butter and sugar until combined. Add egg, egg yolk and vanilla. Reduce speed to low. Alternate adding remaining wet and dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Form dough into two disks, 1/4-inch thick. Wrap in plastic and chill for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325&#8457;.</li>
        <li>Take dough out of refrigerator and let sit for 5 minutes. Roll out on floured surface. Cut into shapes. (Hint: Flour the cookie cutters if you're having trouble with sticking.)</li>
        <li>Transfer cookies to parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12 to 16 minutes, or until lightly golden with edges just beginning to brown. Cool completely on racks.</li>
        <h4>Make the Frosting</h4>
        <li>Combine all frosting ingredients and beat until tripled in volume. Add a splash of water or milk as necessary for consistency.</li>
        <h4>The Fun Part!</h4>
        <li>Frost your cookies. Get creative! Split the frosting into multiple small bowls and add a drop or two of different food colorings to each.</li>
    </ol>
